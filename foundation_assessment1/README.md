1.1 - 1 - Great definitions and benefits of Python!

1.2 - 0 - The question was asking for the string method count, very similar but its the number of times a substring occurs in a string. Also your example is slightly wrong, it should be ages.count(10)

1.3 - 1

1.4 - 1 - There's an easier way to slice the .csv extension off a string, look into reverse slicing. Your method for this one string works but it will fail for different length strings.

1.5 - 1 - Amazing knowledge of Lists and Tuples!

1.6 - 1

1.7 - 1

1.8 - 1

1.9 - 0 - What you've described is how to add elements to a list nested in a dictionary value. If you'd have stated my_dict["Name"] = "Guru" you would've got the mark.

1.10 - 0 - List, Dict and Set are all Mutable. Bool, Int, Tuple and Str are Immuatable.

2 - 1 - You've misunderstood the question, we want to count all the uppercase characters not convert all the characters to uppercase. Your file read works and you use the str method upper which shows a base knowledge.

3 - 7 - A clean efficient solution. Minimal fuss just a nice reverse slice.

4 - 8 - Amazing!! I've never used or seen the key argument for the max function before! I've learnt something new and that's a VERY neat solution.

5 - 18 - Amazing calculator, you've broken the code down nicely into management chunks. Your input code snippets for obtaining variables a and b could be outside the if/elif blocks significantly reducing the repeat code in your answer.

6.4 - 1 - Great knowledge of WHERE and HAVING and how to apply HAVING.

6.5 - 1 - Perfect CHECK constraint answer!

6.6 - 1 - Great knowledge of JOINs and a good use of diagrams to backup your descriptions.

9 - 8 - Good table and use of different types, I'd like to see some NOT NULLs or constraints. Decimal is also an odd one because although on paper it sounds great it's basically FLOAT but truncates your data, without constraints this might not give you what you want.

Overall - 55 - Great! You only dropped 3 marks from the theory questions! Your base knowledge is amazing! You just need to work on your time management. You completed all the single mark questions and left a lot of the bulkier ones. Try quickly going through the small questions next time skipping the ones you can't answer quickly and give yourself enough time for the big markers also one markers should be answered in a sentence or two so try to avoid writing too much. Great effort it's just purely time management.

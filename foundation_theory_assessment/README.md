# 1. Python Theory Questions

3 - 1/1 - PEP8 has good guidelines but rules like `Use maximum 80 columns for your code` are just outdated these days.

9 - 1/1 - GIL ensures one thread is using the python interpreter but that doesn't make threading impossible.
10 - 1/1 - BDUP is typically linked to waterwall but there's benefits in thinking about the really large parts of the design first, however short. There's a Rough Design Up Front which I like. Same general idea but with way less detail.
11 - 1/1 - great answer on the garbage collector, you may find times when you need to run this in your programme, well worth remembering.

16 - 1/1 - take a look at the tool "black" too, pretty handy.

18 - 1/1 - Nice dictionary/list comprehensions! You've written way too much for this single mark though, two sentences were enough.

22 - 1/1 - Lovely slicing!
23 - 1/1
24 - 1/1 - you know I had no idea about the square bracket syntax for ternary operators! A lot of my python experience is from python 2 so I feel I've missed this!!
25 - 1/1 - I love using kwargs and I usually do it with **{} where {} can be any dictionary! It'll read the keys in as the variable name and assign it the value!
26 - 0/1 - range/xrange is a tricky question. There's only a difference in python 2, in python 3 range is equivalent to xrange in python 2.

3 - 1/1 - I had no idea about fromkeys, seems interesting.
4 - 1/1 - get() defaults to None if not found and should be the default mechanism for obtaining a dictionary value in my opinion.
5 - 1/1
6 - 1/1 - similar to items too but keys is powerful when you list the object.
7 - 1/1
8 - 1/1 - loving the python version you quote for popitem to work!

# 6. Python set methods

1 - 1/1
2 - 1/1 - you know I've never used the clear method on any of these, just reassigned to an empty whatever (less characters)
3 - 1/1
4 - 0/1 - difference() only returns the elements in set 1 that aren't in set 2 (it won't return set 2s differences).
5 - 1/1
6 - 1/1
7 - 1/1
8 - 1/1 - pop for a set?! What a useless method.
9 - 1/1
10 - 1/1 - symmetric_difference is a neat method, I've used that a couple of times. Nice and neat when you need/remember it.

OVERALL - Amazing effort! Well done, you've really put in some hard graft here. Try to vaguely remember these methods, most you'll use sparingly but they'll get you out of a bind when you least expect it. Keep it up.

### Question 2 (Yoga Booking System)

Great answer and breakdown of the various system parts and workstreams. I'm not sure how easy some of these descriptions are to pick up and run with particularly for a prototype, how much of this is expected and essential in the 2 weeks? There's also the potential there's a lot here but that's only because these blocks of work could grow if you're not careful, figuring out essentials for each part would help. Other than that there's clear differences in the type of work, UI/backend/designer and you've got a good initial breakdown of what's needed in the database.

### Question 1 (Cinema Booking System)

Awesome answer! Your diagram is great and clearly marks what tables and columns you need as well as the mapping, great work! In terms of the common/biggest problems I think you might be missing some big hitters, I'm thinking of a payment system, security and buggy/laggy UI/backend but that's thinking more than just the database but still worth considering (you might need to store card details for example if you're making the payment system yourself). It'd be good to get an idea of the tools you'd use for this too? We've got an API and DB but what tools are we thinking? MySQL and Flask or something else?

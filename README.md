Submitted work for CFG Full Stack Degree

## Homeworks

### Week 1

Overall:
Great start! Keep up the hard work. It was only task 3.1 that really stumped you a little but other than that your queries were clean, well written and nicely formatted. Just keep an eye on extranious data in your SELECTs. If there's no need to return it don't. Great job and keep it up!
55/65 - 85%

### Week 2

SQL:
Great definitions and examples. I struggled to see the sweet and bank questions in your document but the sweet was definitely in an example but these questions needed explaining. Keep up the hard work and try not to miss questions!
19/30 - 63%

Python:
You've got the fundamentals! There's just a couple of places where it's tripping you up and that'll come in time. A few of the list slicing questions got you so look over the 3 parts you can use to slice a list/string [start, end, step]. Other than that it's just not missing key parts to the question. Fundamentals are there, it's just practice and building now!
30/40 - 75%

Overall:
Next time could you please upload separate code files too (in this case `.sql` and `.py`) as there were a couple of times indentation of a copy/paste error could've got you! It's great to see your knowledge growing, there's just a couple of targeted places you need to focus in on. Keep it up!
49/70 - 70%

### Week 3

There's some really great code here which shows your clearly know the fundamentals. A lot of the marks dropped at due to really minor things like gaps in conditional statements, exceptions misspelt and not fully completing the question. The code is genuinely great, it's just fine tuning now.

50/65 - 77%

### Week 4

Under a big time constraint you did well! Especially given you skipped over the unit testing. I've added an example to help, please reach out and ask questions if it doesn't make sense or it confused you more!!

21/43 - 49%

### Week 5-6

Smashed it, great answers and insights into how you'd go about designing systems end-to-end, it's great to see.
